Project objectives
The main objective of the project will be to create a web application that acts as a platform for fans of various fandoms to interact in a seamless way. Users of the application will be able to share and view content in every fandom they are part of in order to connect with other fans.

Key users
The key users of this application will be general fans, cosplayers and artist/vendor. A general fan wants to discuss and share all content regarding the fandom. A cosplayer is a person who dresses up as a character from their fandom. Cosplayers would like to connect with other cosplayers to discuss ideas for costumes. They would also like to share their costumes from events to the general fandom. An artist/vendor is a person who creates and sells merchandise pertaining to specific fandoms. They would like to promote their merchandise relevant to the fandom, with other members of the fandom as potential buyers.

Every user regardless of their level or participation rate will be able to connect with others, post or establish a presence on Fanlinc for free.
 
Principle: User’s control over information
The design should provide users with control over the information that they share, such who the information is shared with and where the information is shared, as well as the ability to remove their information from Fanlinc.

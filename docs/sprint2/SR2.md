Practices to continue to next sprint
  > Workflow
    - Creating branches for each feature
    - Issuing a pull request
    - Merging branch to develop after 2 approvals
    - Merging develop to master after end of sprint
  > Making sure we follow requirements from handouts

New Practices
  > Assign reviewers - one expert and another beginner (which will be subjective to each task)
  > Communicate every time we create a pull request
  > Adhere to Google Java style guide for back-end code and Airbnb JavaScript style guide for front-end code
  
Harmful Practices
  > Not having enough people reviewing PRs
  > Inconsistent formatting and style of code
  > Taking too many stories in the sprint
  
Best/Worst Experience
> Worst: PRs getting stuck for a long time
> Best: We managed to get a large amount of stories complete

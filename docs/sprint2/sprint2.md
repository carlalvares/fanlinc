UI Planning for feed and profiles
We decided on the landing page for the users: a new user will land on their profile page after registration and an old user will land on the feed page after login. Post creation will be available on the feed page. Upon a post creation, the page will refresh to set the latest post on top of the feed.

Technical Details
We decided on using cookies to track the active user for the "session". We will be working with a test database of predefined fandoms which will be used by the users to join or post in.

Updating Design Document/Unit Tests
Every assignee is responsible for adding CRC cards/docstrings as needed for their parts of the code with respect to their assigned tasks. They are also responsible for creating unit tests. 

Task Assignment
We set priorities for the sprint and divided tasks among ourselves as outlined below. Furthermore, stories were added to Jira, divided into tasks and assigned equally to all team members.

### Fandom Feed 
We decided the description of each fandom should be displayed as a header on top of each fandom tab in the main feed. This header will contain a join/leave button, name of fandom, description of the fandom and a picture of the fandom. 

### Fandom Sidebar and Suggested Fandoms Sidebar
The join fandom button will be on top of the fandom sidebar in the main feed page. There will be a seperate sidebar for "suggested fandom" where a user can join the fandom. 

### Like functionality on Posts
Posts will have a like count.

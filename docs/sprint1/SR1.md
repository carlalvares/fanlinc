Practices to continue to next sprint
  > Workflow
    - Creating branches for each feature
    - Issuing a pull requesting
    - Merging branch to develop after 2 approvals 
    - Merging develop to master after end of sprint
  > Making sure we follow requirements from handouts
    
New Practices
  > Focus more on core features
  > Assign reviewers - one expert and another beginner (which will be subjective to each task)
  > Communicate everytime we create a pull request
  > The creator of PR should merge after 2 approvals
  > Get everything done by sunday night so that we can conduct final tests on monday
  > Be more collaborative
  > Meetup mid sprint or mid week in person to discuss conflicts and issues
  > Add testing tickets on Jira
  
Harmful Practices
  > Not allocating enough time so that we can test our code
  > Not looking up the specifics in the handout before the sprint planning meeting
  > Not asking questions when there is a conflict
  
Best/Worst Experience
> Worst: Checking the requirements late in the sprint and realizing more tasks were needed to be added
> Best: Everyone was cooperative and helpful to each other

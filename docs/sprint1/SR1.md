Practices to continue to next sprint

    b.Issuing a pull requesting
    c.Merging branch to develop after 2 approvals 
    d.Merging develop to master after end of sprint
  2.Making sure we follow requirements from handouts
    
New Practices
  1.Focus more on core features
  2.Assign reviewers - one expert and another beginner (which will be subjective to each task)
  3.Communicate everytime we create a pull request
  4.The creator of PR should merge after 2 approvals
  5.Get everything done by sunday night so that we can conduct final tests on monday
  6.Be more collaborative
  7.Meetup mid sprint or mid week in person to discuss conflicts and issues
  8.Add testing tickets on Jira
  
Harmful Practices
  1.Not allocating enough time so that we can test our code
  2.Not looking up the specifics in the handout before the sprint planning meeting
  3.Not asking questions when there is a conflict
  
Best/Worst Experience
Worst: Checking the requirements late in the sprint and realizing more tasks were needed to be added
Best: Everyone was cooperative and helpful to each other

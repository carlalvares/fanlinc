As we are building a full-stack web application, we decided to define the
"done" state of a story as when that story has had both its back-end components
as well as front-end components complete. Essentially, the story must be ready
as a feature. We will be able to gauge its completion using our criteria of
completion, namely that the story meets the user requirements exactly. We will
get our Product Owner to verify this. In addition, we also want to make sure
that our stories are fully tested before being "done" so we will ensure that
unit tests have been written for them. These unit tests should run with no
failures before the story is considered "done". This will prevent any
complications and unexpected behaviour when it is merged.
